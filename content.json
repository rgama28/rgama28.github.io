  "aboutParagraphs": [
    "I'm Robert, a second-year Economics & Psychology student at Claremont McKenna College and a Robert Day and Henry R. Kravis Scholar. I grew up in Pomona, CA as a first-generation American, my background shapes how I think about opportunity and access in business.",
    "I'm interested in consulting because it combines strategic thinking, teamwork, and solving real problems. I co-founded Cariño Botánica, a zero-waste refill store serving the Inland Empire, and I currently help advise businesses become more sustainable through Claremont Sustainability Consulting.",
    "Outside of academics and business, I'm involved in Scholars of Finance, co-founded CMC's Breakfast Club, and perform with Mariachi Serrano de los Claremont Colleges. In my free time, I read, garden, and stay active through rock climbing, running, and yoga."
